## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- There are times that I forget to bring my cards, which makes me wonder if I can do a magic trick on computer.
- It’s a good way to learn how Python classes work ... figuring out each one takes time, though (^_^)a.
- I like to fill my desktop with interesting programs. They look cool.
