## 🛠️ Why I Built This
- I often need to jot down notes, highlight ideas, or illustrate concepts directly on my desktop.
- Being able to turn my computer into a simple “blackboard” whenever I need it is super handy.
- I’m also using this project as a chance to get better at building desktop apps with PySide2 / Qt.
